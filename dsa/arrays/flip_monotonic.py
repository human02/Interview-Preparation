"""

Given an array of 0s and 1s. Perform flip operations to make it monotonic.
Return the minimum operation needed to do it.

1s can be flipped to 0s and vice-versa.

Example 1:
Input: arr = [0,0,0,1,1,0]
Output: 1
Explanation: We flip the last 0 to a 1.

Example 2:
Input: arr = [0,0,0,1,1,1]
Output: 0

Example 3:
Input: arr = [1,1,1,0,0,0]
Output: 3

Example 4:
Input: arr = [1,0,0,0,0,0]
Output: 1

Constraints:
    Only 0 or 1 in the array
