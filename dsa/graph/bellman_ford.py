Bellman ford algorithm

Given a weighted and directed graph of V vertices and E edges. An edge is represented as [ai, bi, wi], meaning there is a
directed edge from ai to bi having weight wi. Find the shortest distance of all the vertices from the source vertex S.
If a vertex can't be reached from the S then mark the distance as 109. If the graph contains a negative cycle then return -1 in a list.

Examples:

Input : V = 6, Edges = [[3, 2, 6], [5, 3, 1], [0, 1, 5], [1, 5, -3], [1, 2, -2], [3, 4, -2], [2, 4, 3]], S = 0
Output: 0 5 3 3 1 2
Explanation:
For node 1, shortest path is 0->1 (distance=5).
For node 2, shortest path is 0->1->2 (distance=3)
For node 3, shortest path is 0->1->5->3 (distance=3)
For node 4, shortest path is 0->1->5->3->4 (distance=1)
For node 5, shortest path is 0->1->5 (distance=2)

Input : V = 2, Edges = [[0,1,9]], S = 0
Output: 0 9
Explanation: For node 1, the shortest path is 0->1 (distance=9)

Input: V=3, Edges = [[0,1,5],[1,0,3],[1,2,-1],[2,0,1]], S = 2
Output: 1 6 0

Constraints:
1 ≤ V ≤ 500
1 ≤ E ≤ V*(V-1)
-1000 ≤ edges[i][3] ≤ 1000
0 ≤ S < V
