Shortest Distance in a Binary Maze

Given an n x m matrix grid where each cell contains either 0 or 1, determine the shortest distance
between a source cell and a destination cell. You can move to an adjacent cell (up, down, left, or right)
if that adjacent cell has a value of 1. The path can only be created out of cells containing 1.
If the destination cell is not reachable from the source cell, return -1.


Example 1
Input: grid = [[1, 1, 1, 1],[1, 1, 0, 1],[1, 1, 1, 1],[1, 1, 0, 0],[1, 0, 0, 1]], source = [0, 1], destination = [2, 2]
Output: 3
Explanation: The shortest path from (0, 1) to (2, 2) is:
    Move down to (1, 1)
    Move down to (2, 1)
    Move right to (2, 2)
    Thus, the shortest distance is 3

Example 2
Input: grid = [[1, 1, 1, 1, 1],[1, 1, 1, 1, 1],[1, 1, 1, 1, 0],[1, 0, 1, 0, 1]], source = [0, 0], destination = [3, 4]
Output: -1
Explanation: Since, there is no path possible between the source cell and the destination cell, hence we return -1.

Example 2
Input: grid = [[1, 0, 1],[1, 1, 0],[1, 1, 1]], source = [0, 0], destination = [2, 2]
Output: 4

Constraints
    1 ≤ n, m ≤ 500
    grid[i][j] == 0 or grid[i][j] == 1
    The source and destination cells are always inside the given matrix.
