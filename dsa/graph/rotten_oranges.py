Rotten Oranges

Given an n x m grid, where each cell has the following values :
2 - represents a rotten orange
1 - represents a Fresh orange
0 - represents an Empty Cell

Every minute, if a fresh orange is adjacent to a rotten orange in 4-direction, it becomes rotten.
Return the minimum number of minutes required such that none of the cells has a Fresh Orange.
If it's not possible, return -1.

Examples:
Input: grid = [ [2, 1, 1] , [0, 1, 1] , [1, 0, 1] ]
Output: -1
Explanation: Orange at (3,0) cannot be rotten.

Input: grid = [ [2,1,1] , [1,1,0] , [0,1,1] ]
Output: 4

Input: grid = [[0,1,2],[0,1,2],[2,1,1]]
Output: 1

Constraints:
  1 <= n, m <= 500
  grid[i][j] == 0 or 1 or 2
