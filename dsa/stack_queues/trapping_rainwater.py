Trapping Rainwater

Given an array of non-negative integers, height representing the elevation of ground.
Calculate the amount of water that can be trapped after rain.


Examples:
Input: height= [0, 1, 0, 2, 1, 0, 1, 3, 2, 1, 2, 1]
Output: 6
Explanation: As seen from the diagram 1+1+2+1+1=6 unit of water can be trapped

Input: height= [4, 2, 0, 3, 2, 5]
Output: 9
Expalanation: 2+4+1+2=9 unit of water can be trapped

Input: height= [7, 4, 0, 9]
Output:10

Constraints:
  n == height.length
  1 <= n <= 105
  0 <= height[i] <= 105
