Segregate odd and even nodes in LL

Given the head of a singly linked list. Group all the nodes with odd indices followed by all the nodes with even
indices and return the reordered list. Consider the 1st node to have index 1 and so on. The relative order of
the elements inside the odd and even group must remain the same as the given input.

Examples:
Input: head -> 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5
Output: head -> 1 -> 3 -> 5 -> 2 -> 4
Explanation: The nodes with odd indices are 1, 3, 5 and the ones with even indices are 2, 4.

Input: head -> 4 -> 3 -> 2 -> 1
Output: head -> 4 -> 2 -> 3 -> 1
Explanation: The nodes with odd indices are 4, 2 and the ones with even indices are 3, 1.

Input: head -> 1
Output: head -> 1

Constraints:
    0 <= number of nodes in the Linked List <= 105
    0 <= ListNode.val <= 104
