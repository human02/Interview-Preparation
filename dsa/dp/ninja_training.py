Ninja's training

A ninja has planned a n-day training schedule. Each day he has to perform one of three activities - running,
stealth training, or fighting practice. The same activity cannot be done on two consecutive days and the ninja
earns a specific number of merit points, based on the activity and the given day.

Given a n x 3-sized matrix, where matrix[i][0], matrix[i][1], and matrix[i][2], represent the merit points associated
with running, stealth and fighting practice, on the (i+1)th day respectively. Return the maximum possible merit points
that the ninja can earn.

Examples:
Input: matrix = [[10, 40, 70], [20, 50, 80], [30, 60, 90]]
Output: 210

Explanation:
Day 1: fighting practice = 70
Day 2: stealth training = 50
Day 3: fighting practice = 90
Total = 70 + 50 + 90 = 210

This gives the optimal points.

Input: matrix = [[70, 40, 10], [180, 20, 5], [200, 60, 30]]
Output: 290

Explanation:
Day 1: running = 70
Day 2: stealth training = 20
Day 3: running = 200
Total = 70 + 20 + 200 = 290
This gives the optimal points.

Input: matrix = [[20, 10, 10], [20, 10, 10], [20, 30, 10]]
Output: 60

Constraints:
1 <= n <= 104
n == number of rows in matrix
3 == number of columns in matrix
0 <= matrix[i][j] <= 1000
