516. Longest Palindromic Subsequence

Given a string, Find the longest palindromic subsequence length in given string.
A palindrome is a sequence that reads the same backwards as forward.
A subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from another sequence by deleting some or no elements
without changing the order of the remaining elements.

Example 1:
Input: s = "eeeme"
Output: 4
Explanation: The longest palindromic subsequence is "eeee", which has a length of 4.

Example 2:
Input: s = "annb"
Output: 2
Explanation: The longest palindromic subsequence is "nn", which has a length of 2.

Example 3:
Input: s = "s"
Output: 1

Constraints:
    1 ≤ s.length ≤ 1000
