Generate Subsequences of a String

Given a string s, return all possible non-empty subsequences of s, sorted in lexicographical order.
A subsequence of a string is a new string generated from the original string with some characters (possibly none)
deleted without changing the relative order of the remaining characters.

Example 1:
Input: s = "ba"
Output: ["a","ab","b"]

Example 2:
Input: s = "xyz"
Output: ["x","xy","xyz","xz","y","yz","z"]

Constraints:
1 <= s.length <= 16
s consists of lowercase English letters.
