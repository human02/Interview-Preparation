Find the Fastest 3 Horses

You have 25 horses and a race track that can accommodate only 5 horses at a time. Each horse has a consistent speed, but you don't have a stopwatch to measure their actual speeds. You can only determine the relative order of horses within each race.
Your task: Write a function that finds the top 3 fastest horses using the minimum number of races.
