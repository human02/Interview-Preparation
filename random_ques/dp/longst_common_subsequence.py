Longest common subsequence
Given two strings str1 and str2, find the length of their longest common subsequence.
A subsequence is a sequence that appears in the same relative order but not necessarily
contiguous and a common subsequence of two strings is a subsequence that is common to both strings.

Examples:
Input: str1 = "bdefg", str2 = "bfg"
Output: 3
Explanation: The longest common subsequence is "bfg", which has a length of 3.

Input: str1 = "mnop", str2 = "mnq"
Output: 2
Explanation: The longest common subsequence is "mn", which has a length of 2.
