"""
You are given an integer array coins representing coins of different denominations (e.g. 1 dollar, 5 dollars, etc)
and an integer amount representing a target amount of money.

Return the fewest number of coins that you need to make up the exact target amount.
If it is impossible to make up the amount, return -1.

Example 1:
Input: coins = [1,5,10], amount = 12
Output: 3

Example 2:
Input: coins = [2], amount = 3
Output: -1

Constraints:
1 <= coins.length <= 12
1 <= coins[i] <= 2^31 - 1
0 <= amount <= 10^4
