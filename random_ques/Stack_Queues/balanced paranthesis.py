Balanced Paranthesis

Given string str containing just the characters '(', ')', '{', '}', '[' and ']', check if the input string is valid 
and return true if the string is balanced otherwise return false.

Example 1:
Input: str = “()[{}()]”

Output: True
Explanation: As every open bracket has its corresponding close bracket. Match parentheses are in correct order 
hence they are balanced.

Example 2:
Input: str = “[()”
Output: False
Explanation: As ‘[‘ does not have ‘]’ hence it is not valid and will return false.

Example 3:
Input: str = "{[()]}"
Output:True

Constraints:
- 1 <= str.length <= 104
- str consists of parentheses only '()[]{}'.
