"""
Number of Connected Components in an Undirected Graph
There is an undirected graph with n nodes. There is also an edges array, where edges[i] = [a, b] means that there is an edge between node a and node b in the graph.
The nodes are numbered from 0 to n - 1.

Return the total number of connected components in that graph.

Example 1:
Input: n=3, edges=[[0,1], [0,2]]
Output: 1

Example 2:
Input: n=6, edges=[[0,1], [1,2], [2,3], [4,5]]
Output: 2

Constraints:
1 <= n <= 100
0 <= edges.length <= n * (n - 1) / 2
