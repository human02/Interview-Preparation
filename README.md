# Note

This is a repo for my personal use only and not for distribution in any circumstance. 

It contains the solution of the coding problems that I solved while preparing for technical interviews.

The dependencies are installed using Poetry. We are using pytest to test the code.

- Use it to run the pytest:

    `pytest "path_to_test_file_test_*.py" -v`
